Want to change:
  + code to create extra point incentive with added detail matching
    - multiscore pairs in consistent amount is optional due to favor of random pattern on the first halfBoard.

  + the displayPrevPlay was added to the DOM for easier gameplay
    - currently it doesn't work on every iteration, it works great on first move and along with invalid play alerts
    - an insert should work under a conditional after the conditional which checks if the play is valid
      it ran errors conflicting with the already existing conditionals.

  + sound effects are good, wants ambient music
  + button for new gameboard instead of just reset, new gameboard button also needs to reset points and restart the timer properly
  + timer still starts too early before first move

  + create a separate competition mode which will make the algorithm render a consistent amount of extra points blocks to create a fair chance of total points for each render.
    - The array catching the color pattern will have to filter smarter in order to randomly duplicate on the second halfBoard without producing too many or too few copies.
