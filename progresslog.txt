Want to change:
  + sound effects are good, wants ambient music
  + button for new gameboard instead of just reset, new gameboard button also needs to reset points and restart the timer properly
  + timer still starts too early before first move
  - alert popup now contains the last play after invalid play. Furthermore the last play should display on DOM immediately because it's easier for regular play.

  + add code to create extra point incentive with added detail matching << en progress
    - multiscore exact amounts is optional due to favor of random pattern on the first halfBoard.
    The array catching the color pattern will have to filter smarter in order to randomly duplicate on the second halfBoard without producing too many or too few copies.



  + create a separate competition mode which will make the algorithm render an even amount of extra points blocks to create a fair chance of total points for each render.
