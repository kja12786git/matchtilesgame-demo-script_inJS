For upgrades:

  + code to create extra point incentive with added detail matching
    + multiscore pairs in consistent amount is optional due to favor of random pattern on the first halfBoard. #non-comp-mode

  + new gameboard button added, refreshes entire page build

  - something changed with either jQuery or browsers which is not display the typed nameInputDiv to nameFeed.

  + the displayPrevPlay was added to the DOM for easier gameplay

  + sound effects are good
    - wants unique new ambient music

  - timer still starts too early before first move.
  - if reset button is hit it cannot reset timer... this may be unfixable in same page load of Javascript..? iFraming the gameboard area may be a solution. There is something about refreshing a div, maybe this can have some power.

  - quality testing on cell phone reveals it gets difficult to function 100% at zoom levels below 100%, but this even smaller because within Codepen iframe which is half the mobile screen.

  + upon reaching to a scope of server logging of scores for highscores... create a separate competition mode which will make the algorithm render a consistent amount of extra points blocks to create a fair chance of total points for each render.
    + The array catching the color pattern will have to filter smarter in order to randomly duplicate on the second halfBoard without producing too many or too few copies.

  + comp-mode-2 reorganize the comp-mode
    + eliminate need for using too much in loops hasMultiscore, itemsnative and dup_limiter loop to get accurate dup_multiscore
    + make a dup_multiscore forloop from colorpattern definition and retune from parts of dup_limiter and itemsnative loop to verify instance counts
    + to perform faster and allow for any amount of multiscore the colorpattern includes...
    + fix inconsistant halfBoard pairing no matter how many blocks the colorpattern includes.

  + comp-mode-2 now renders great
    - give variation to colorpattern code so it will have a different wave upon every render
