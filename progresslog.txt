Codepen copy - https://codepen.io/kjerrya/pen/ypBomO

Want to change:
  - needs its own music, similar stuff
  - when the notification was fixed, the initial score went defunct... it was only counting points the first instance
  - the notifications are redundant... showing the result of the entire playLog
  - button for new gameboard instead of just reset
  - it's not backwards compatible across browsers but works with webkit
  - at the end of the game process it seems the playCount is being limited to something other than the playLog count...
