Codepen copy - https://codepen.io/kjerrya/pen/ypBomO

Want to change:
  + sound effects are good, wants ambient music
  + button for new gameboard instead of just reset, new gameboard button also needs to reset points and restart the timer properly
  + timer still starts too early before first move
  + show the last play to player to make gameplay easier, maybe ommit on higher difficulty choice

  + add code to create extra point incentive with added detail matching << en progress
    - Last update worked well to add css class to selected list items, have to figure out how to get the 'halfBoard' duplicates to also take the same style codes.
