Want to change:
  + sound effects are good, wants ambient music
  + button for new gameboard instead of just reset, new gameboard button also needs to reset points and restart the timer properly
  + timer still starts too early before first move
  + show the last play to player to make gameplay easier, maybe omit on higher difficulty choice

  + add code to create extra point incentive with added detail matching << en progress
    - have to make sure multiscore duplication does exact amount for each occurrence now since
      the filter works to stop it from doing too many now
