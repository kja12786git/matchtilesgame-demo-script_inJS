For upgrades:

  + code to create extra point incentive with added detail matching
    - multiscore pairs in consistent amount is optional due to favor of random pattern on the first halfBoard.

  + new gameboard button added, refreshes entire page build

  + the displayPrevPlay was added to the DOM for easier gameplay

  + sound effects are good
    - wants unique new ambient music

  - timer still starts too early before first move

  - quality testing on cell phone reveals it gets difficult to function 100% at zoom levels below 100%, but this even smaller because within Codepen iframe which is half the mobile screen.

  + create a separate competition mode which will make the algorithm render a consistent amount of extra points blocks to create a fair chance of total points for each render.
    - The array catching the color pattern will have to filter smarter in order to randomly duplicate on the second halfBoard without producing too many or too few copies.
