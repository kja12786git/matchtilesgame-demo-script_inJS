For upgrades:

  + code to create extra point incentive with added detail matching
    + multiscore pairs in consistent amount is optional due to favor of random pattern on the first halfBoard. #non-comp-mode

  + new gameboard button added, refreshes entire page build

  + the displayPrevPlay was added to the DOM for easier gameplay

  + sound effects are good
    - wants unique new ambient music...

  + multiplier countup timer display and logic updated to be more responsive to every play.
    - if reset button refreshes the build, the countup works, however, the speed seems to double the rate.
    Redefining startTimer on the reset may fix this, but I think the DOM has to reset the timer itself.

  - quality testing on cell phone reveals it gets difficult to function 100% at zoom levels below 100%, but this even smaller because within Codepen iframe which is half the mobile screen.

  + upon reaching to a scope of server logging of scores for highscores... create a separate competition mode which will make the algorithm render a consistent amount of extra points blocks to create a fair chance of total points for each render.
    + The array catching the color pattern will have to filter smarter in order to randomly duplicate on the second halfBoard without producing too many or too few copies.

  + comp-mode colorpattern multiscore increased for more dynamic gameboard.
    + more in depth conditionals worked to get accurate instance render.
    + skip-loop doesn't work here due to render works different than more concise one for comp-mode-2.
    + Renders work well 100% of the renders.

  + comp-mode-2 reorganizes the comp-mode
    + eliminate need for using too much in loops hasMultiscore, itemsnative and dup_limiter loop to get accurate dup_multiscore
    + make a dup_multiscore forloop from colorpattern definition and retune from parts of dup_limiter and itemsnative loop to verify instance counts
    + to perform faster and allow for any amount of multiscore the colorpattern includes...
    + fix inconsistant halfBoard pairing no matter how many blocks the colorpattern includes.

  + comp-mode-2 and comp-mode both render as desired
    - give variation to colorpattern renders so both modes can render unique patterns each time...
      mode-1 delivers superior game pattern challenge because it randomizes 2nd halfBoard due to dependency on reversing the array
      mode-2 technically renders faster but it doesn't randomize any because it's not depending on the first array.
