Want to change:
  - need to fine tune timer for desired accuracy on the DOM and ensure it is scoring accurate to user delay in between each play
  - needs its own music, similar stuff
  - button for new gameboard instead of just reset
  - prospective reset or new gameboard button also needs to reset points and restart the timer properly
  - it's not backwards compatible across browsers but works with webkit
