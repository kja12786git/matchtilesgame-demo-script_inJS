Want to change:
  - needs its own music, similar stuff
  - when the notification was fixed, the initial score went defunct... it was only counting points the first instance
  - the notifications are redundant
  - button for new gameboard instead of just reset
  - it's not backwards compatible across browsers but works with webkit
  - at the end of it the last match cannot complete for some reason
